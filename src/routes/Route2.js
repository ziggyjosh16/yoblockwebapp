<ol>
<li>While digital products such as photos/music have made it easy to acquire, store, and move across devices, the same advantage makes it really easy to copy them and steal them.
</li>
<li>Centralized music streaming platforms such as spotify have issues of ingenuine practices and inherent bias.
</li>
<li>The lackluster implementation and inaccessibility of blockchain technology has made users( listeners) reluctant to adopt it.
